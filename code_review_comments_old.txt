The clock.c file looks fine. There is one issue with the CLOCK_Initialize() function. The __builtin_write_OSCCONH() and __builtin_write_OSCCONL() macros should be used to unlock the OSCCON register before writing to it.
This code appears to be responsible for switching the clock source on a device. It is waiting for the OSCCONbits.OSWEN bit to be cleared and the OSCCONbits.LOCK bit to be set before continuing.

1. The comments could be more informative. For example, it is not clear why the Analog/Digital Configuration SFRs are being set.

1. The code is missing a #define LED_C_SetDigitalInput() statement.

2. The code should use LED_C_SetHigh() and LED_C_SetLow() instead of _LATB5 = 1 and _LATB5 = 0.

Overall, the code looks well organized and easy to read. However, there is one error that will prevent the code from compiling successfully. On line 74, there is an unfinished variable declaration (uint16_t dataRe) that should be completed or removed. Other than that, the code looks good.
Overall, the code looks well organized and easy to read. However, there are a few things that could be improved.

First, it would be helpful to add comments explaining what the code is doing. In particular, it is not immediately clear what the purpose of the SPI1_Exchange() function is.

Second, it would be more efficient to use a single SPI1STAT check for both the transmit and receive operations, rather than separate checks for each.

The timer interrupt service routine (ISR) should be as short and efficient as
possible. In this instance, the entire body of the ISR is contained within a
single if statement. This is good practice and keeps the ISR short and
efficient.

1. TMR2 is not a good name for a timer driver, since that is the name of the actual hardware timer module.

The code looks fine. There is one potential issue with the TMR2_GetElapsedThenClear() function. If the timerElapsed flag is set to true in the middle of execution of this function, then the flag will be cleared before it is checked again in the next iteration.
